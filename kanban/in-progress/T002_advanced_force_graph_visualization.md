# T002: Advanced Force-Directed Graph Visualization with Smooth Transitions

## 1. Goal

Implement a sophisticated force-directed graph visualization using react-force-graph-2d that displays relationship labels on edges, provides smooth animated transitions when changing active nodes, and handles TypeScript integration challenges for a polished interactive experience.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

### 2.1 Visual Relationship Display
- [ ] Edge labels clearly display relationship text (e.g., "implements", "requires")
- [ ] Labels are positioned at the midpoint of edges with readable contrast
- [ ] Labels scale appropriately with zoom level and remain legible
- [ ] Directional arrows indicate relationship direction
- [ ] Labels handle text overflow gracefully (truncation or wrapping)

### 2.2 Smooth Animated Transitions
- [ ] When active node changes, graph smoothly transitions to new filtered state
- [ ] Nodes fade in/out when entering/leaving visible set
- [ ] Existing nodes smoothly reposition when graph structure changes
- [ ] Transition duration is configurable (default: 800ms)
- [ ] Physics simulation continues smoothly during transitions
- [ ] No jarring jumps or sudden layout changes

### 2.3 Enhanced Node Interaction
- [ ] Active node is visually distinct (larger, different color, highlighted border)
- [ ] Hover effects show node definitions in elegant tooltips
- [ ] Click transitions are smooth with visual feedback
- [ ] Distance-based node styling (color gradients by distance from active)
- [ ] Selected nodes (shift-click) have distinct visual treatment

### 2.4 Technical Integration
- [ ] TypeScript compatibility with react-force-graph-2d resolved
- [ ] Custom node and edge rendering functions work correctly
- [ ] SSR compatibility maintained with Next.js
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with 100+ nodes
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for frequent re-renders

## 4. Technical Challenges

### 4.1 TypeScript Integration Issues
**Challenge**: react-force-graph-2d has complex generic types that don't align well with our custom UI interfaces.
**Impact**: Build failures and type safety concerns.
**Proposed Solution**: Create wrapper components with proper type casting and interface adapters.

### 4.2 Edge Label Rendering
**Challenge**: Canvas-based edge labels require custom rendering logic for proper positioning and readability.
**Impact**: Poor user experience if labels overlap, are unreadable, or positioned incorrectly.
**Proposed Solution**: Implement sophisticated text measurement and positioning algorithms with collision detection.

### 4.3 Smooth Transition Management
**Challenge**: Coordinating physics simulation, node visibility, and layout changes during active node transitions.
**Impact**: Jarring user experience without smooth animations.
**Proposed Solution**: State-driven transition system with interpolated physics parameters and fade animations.

### 4.4 Performance with Complex Graphs
**Challenge**: Canvas rendering performance degrades with many nodes and frequent updates.
**Impact**: Poor user experience with lag during interactions.
**Proposed Solution**: Optimized rendering pipeline, memoization, and selective re-draws.

## 5. Proposed Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Component Structure
```
AdvancedConceptVisualization/
├── ForceGraphWrapper.tsx          // Type-safe wrapper around react-force-graph-2d
├── TransitionManager.tsx          // Handles smooth state transitions
├── EdgeLabelRenderer.tsx          // Custom edge label rendering logic
├── NodeStyleManager.tsx           // Advanced node styling and interactions
├── TooltipSystem.tsx             // Elegant hover tooltips
└── PerformanceMonitor.tsx        // Performance tracking and optimization
```

### 5.2 Data Flow
1. Repository.ConceptMap → GraphData transformation
2. TransitionManager coordinates state changes
3. ForceGraphWrapper applies type-safe rendering
4. EdgeLabelRenderer handles relationship display
5. NodeStyleManager applies visual states
6. User interactions trigger smooth transitions

### 5.3 State Management
- Current graph data (nodes/edges with visual properties)
- Transition state (from/to states, animation progress)
