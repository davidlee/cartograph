# cartograph

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app for authoring and exploring [Concept Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map), authored using Claude Code. 

Take a look at the doc and kanban folders - it's better documented than most projects (by necessity).

## Current Status

Working proof of concept.
- Functional parser, repository
- Minimal but working UI for exploring existing maps.
- Somewhat janky transitions.
- No editor.
